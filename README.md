# BAYES STAR

**Note** This is experimental software and for education and scientific purposes only.
The user must accept any liability for any mistakes, damage, loss or other suffering that result from the use of this software.

## Impact
This **BAYES STAR** software package, I claim, unblocks **AGI**, by providing a "logical inference engine" that can do reasoning.

## Usage
For instructions on how to use the software see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

## Documentation

### arXiv Paper
There is an [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06557) paper now and I will add more links to the stuff "published to Bitcoin".
As noted below, there is also a lot of multi-media content on my Twitter at [@coppola_ai](https://twitter.com/coppola_ai).

## References
Here are some references that inspired this paper [BibTeX File](paper/bibtex.bib), but I have to unify over a few different bibtex files.

### Time-Stamping of Ideas on Bitcoin Chain
For time-stamping, I have put all of my work on the Bitcoin Blockchain ([address1](https://ordinals.hiro.so/inscriptions?a=bc1pjlpr5nzl6cmljtyz0a3gng98y3r5hs8z68gw55vg4ccjptvj9msq5gqrc5), [address2](https://ordinals.hiro.so/inscriptions?a=bc1pvd4selnseakwz5eljgj4d99mka25mk8pp3k7v7hc6uxw8txy6lgsf7lmtg)).
This provides a crypto-graphically secure time-stamping and immutable recording of each idea, whose accuracy is guarnateed by the value of the Bitcoin chain (almost $1 trillion).
