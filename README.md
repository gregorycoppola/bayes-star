# BAYES STAR

This software package provides a reference implementation of a:
* Logical Bayesian Network


## Impact
This **BAYES STAR** software package implements this [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06557), and provides a *unified model* of *probabilistic* and *logical* reasoning.

## Usage
For instructions on how to use the software see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

## Documentation

### arXiv Paper
There is an [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06557) now and I will add more links to the stuff "published to Bitcoin".
As noted below, there is also a lot of multi-media content on my Twitter at [@coppola_ai](https://twitter.com/coppola_ai).

## References
Here are some references that inspired this paper [BibTeX File](paper/bibtex.bib).

### Time-Stamping of Ideas on Bitcoin Chain
For time-stamping, I have put all of my work on the Bitcoin Blockchain ([address1](https://ordinals.hiro.so/inscriptions?a=bc1pjlpr5nzl6cmljtyz0a3gng98y3r5hs8z68gw55vg4ccjptvj9msq5gqrc5), [address2](https://ordinals.hiro.so/inscriptions?a=bc1pvd4selnseakwz5eljgj4d99mka25mk8pp3k7v7hc6uxw8txy6lgsf7lmtg)).
This provides a crypto-graphically secure time-stamping and immutable recording of each idea, whose accuracy is guarnateed by the value of the Bitcoin chain (almost $1 trillion).
