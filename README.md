# BAYES STAR

## Introduction
This software package introduces the **Quantified Bayesian Network** (**QBN**).
The QBN generalizes 1) traditional generative Bayesian Networks, and 2) First-Order Logic.

The end result, I claim, is that:
* the QBN allows a *generative* model of logical (i.e., linguistic) knowledge **that does not hallucinate**

## Documentation

I will be adding the documentation starting now. This is a "developing in public" process.

I tweet a lot as [@coppola_ai](https://twitter.com/coppola_ai) on **X**.

And, I will be uploading videos to [@coppola_ai](https://www.youtube.com/@coppola_ai) on **YouTube**.
