# BAYES STAR

## Introduction
This software package introduces the **Quantified Bayesian Network** (**QBN**).
The QBN generalizes 1) traditional generative Bayesian Networks, and 2) First-Order Logic.

The end result, I claim, is that:
* the QBN allows a *generative* model linguistic knowledge **that does not hallucinate**
