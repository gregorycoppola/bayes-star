# BAYES STAR

## Abstract
This **BAYES STAR** software package, I claim, unblocks **AGI**, by providing a "logical inference engine" that can do reasoning.

If you are interested in **AGI** you should be interested in this.

## Usage
For instructions on how to use the software see [USAGE.md](USAGE.md).

## The Quantified Bayesian Network

For technical details on the **Quantified Bayesian Network**, see [QBN.md](QBN.md).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Find the answers to FAQ's at [FAQ.md](FAQ.md).

## Documentation

## Draft Latex Paper
I am putting all the "real" equations in an academic-style Latex-created [pdf document](paper/symbolic-logic-also-needed-DRAFT.pdf).
This is still in DRAFT STAGE.
As noted below, there is also a lot of multi-media content on my Twitter at [@coppola_ai](https://twitter.com/coppola_ai).
### Developing in Public
I am taking a "developing in public" vibe for this project.
I will ultimately publish a traditional paper to arXiv, if not elsewhere.

### Too Many Papers
But, I am agreeing with those who are saying there are "too many papers".
I have primarily a small core of ideas to communicate (e.g., the QBN).
I am happy to make any multi-media that helps people understand the idea.

### Tweet Threads
I have many tweet threads now discussing various aspects of this problem at [@coppola_ai](https://twitter.com/coppola_ai).
Actually, in some ways, this can be "better than a paper", or at least a great supplement to a paper, because:
* each idea is broken into little chunks
* there is multi-media
* you can start reading a chain and stop if you don't like the topic

I would like to organize the threads but that will come at the expense of just adding more content.

## References
The references file is a pretty good indication of the research that led to the QBN.
It is a lot of old-school 80's, 90's, 2000's (the "Baum" paper is from 1966).

This is based on my experience doing:
1. Master of Arts in Linguistics, focus on the "Meaning" of Natural Language, Simon Fraser University, 2007-2009
2. PhD in Computer Science, focus on Artificial Intelligence, The University of Edinburgh, 2009-2014
3. Experience in industry research and engineering (FAANG company)

See the [BibTeX File](paper/bibtex.bib) for references.

### Time-Stamping of Ideas on Bitcoin Chain
For time-stamping, I have put all of my work on the Bitcoin Blockchain ([address1](https://ordinals.hiro.so/inscriptions?a=bc1pjlpr5nzl6cmljtyz0a3gng98y3r5hs8z68gw55vg4ccjptvj9msq5gqrc5), [address2](https://ordinals.hiro.so/inscriptions?a=bc1pvd4selnseakwz5eljgj4d99mka25mk8pp3k7v7hc6uxw8txy6lgsf7lmtg)).
This provides a crypto-graphically secure time-stamping and immutable recording of each idea, whose accuracy is guarnateed by the value of the Bitcoin chain (almost $1 trillion).
