# BAYES STAR

## Why Should I Care About This?
This **BAYES STAR** software package implements a "QBN" which will allow **AGI**.

So, if you are interested in **AGI** you should be interested in this.

## The Quantified Bayesian Network
This software package introduces the **Quantified Bayesian Network** (**QBN**).
The QBN generalizes 1) traditional generative Bayesian Networks, and 2) First-Order Logic.

The end result, I claim, is that:
* the QBN allows a *generative* model of logical (i.e., linguistic) knowledge **that does not hallucinate**

## How Does the QBN Avoid Hallucinations?
The QBN avoids hallucinations by:
1. using logic
2. understanding how to explain its argument
3. understands that there are things it does not know

How does it do this?
1. using logic -- the QBN generalizes (though in a complex way) first-order logic
2. using ideas from classical Bayesian Networks -- allows us to create a generative story based on "causality"

## Documentation

I have the notes for a paper, but have to clean them up. So, the paper is coming.

I will be adding the informal documentation (markdown, tweets and videos) starting now. This is a "developing in public" process.
