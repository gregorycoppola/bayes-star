# CHANGELOG

## namespaceit0107
This PR is about seting up all of the objects in the ontology or universe to live in:
* consistent namespaces -- so that all of the namespaces can run together
* iterating over objects -- define and make iterable all the things we surface to the user

### Namespaces
Want each experiment to exist in its on persistent "namespace".

Maybe this can work by prepending the "experiment" name in front.

Then, we have a list of "experiment names".. that gets you all of these other lists.

### Iteration
We have to be able to iterate over:

* DOMAIN Names
* VERBs
* entities in domains
* specific propositions "that we know"


## cleanup0107
* just clean up the code
* run through all the scenarios and see if they all still work
