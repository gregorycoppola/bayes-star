# Installing Redis on Your System

**Do not run this software if you already have a Redis database on 'localhost' because it will get cleared.**

Redis is an advanced key-value store, known for its flexibility, performance, and wide language support. This guide will walk you through the installation process for Redis on various operating systems.

Remember you can always ask your favorite "chat bot" if you get stuck.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of command line operations.
- Administrative or root access on your system.

## Installing on Linux
### Debian/Ubuntu
1. Update your package list: 
   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
2. Install Redis:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install redis-server
   ```
3. Start Redis:
   ```
   sudo service redis-server start
   ```

### CentOS/RedHat
1. Add the EPEL repository:
   ```
   sudo yum install epel-release
   ```
2. Install Redis:
   ```
   sudo yum install redis
   ```
3. Start Redis:
   ```
   sudo systemctl start redis

## Installing on Windows
Redis does not natively support Windows. However, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or a Windows-compatible version of Redis.
1. [Enable WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on Windows 10/11.
2. Follow the Linux installation steps within WSL.

## Installing on macOS
1. Install Homebrew if it's not already installed:
   ```
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
   ```
2. Install Redis:
   ```
   brew install redis
   ```
3. Start Redis:
   ```
   brew services start redis
   ```

## Verifying the Installation
After installation, you can verify that Redis is running correctly:
```
redis-cli ping
```
If Redis is running, it will return:
```
PONG
```

## Next Steps
Now that Redis is installed, you can start using it in your projects. Check out the official [Redis documentation](https://redis.io/documentation) for more information on how to use Redis.
