# Bayes-Star Usage Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to set up and run the Bayes-Star project.

**At any time if you get stuck, just ask your favorite "chat bot"**. Keeping docs up to date has always been impossible but you can just get your favorite chat bot to explain things to you if you know how to ask. I used [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) in the creation of this project.

## Prerequisites

The main program is written in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

There is right now some analysis code written in [python3](https://www.python.org/). But, if you want to use a different language for analysis, you don't have to use python.

### Installing Node.js Program on Your System

To install Node.js, visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the instructions provided by the installer to complete the installation.

If you encounter any issues or need more detailed instructions tailored to your specific computing environment, consider using your favorite chatbot (like OpenAI's ChatGPT) for guidance.

## Install the BAYES STAR Package
You have to `cd` into the `node` directory and do a `npm install` to install the dependencies:


```
cd node
npm install
```

You can find the dependencies in the file [package.json](node/package.json).
